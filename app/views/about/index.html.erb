          About Me
          <div class="info">
            My name is David Tran, a first generation Asian American. I have a wide variety of interests ranging from cooking, snowboarding, welding, gaming, and hundreds of other things that I want to eventually pick up. Most of which developed from my previous jobs - a chef, welder, commercial driver, English teacher, grocery stocker. For 9 years of my life after high school, I simply worked. But I just wanted more.. A challenge, security, opportunities for growth, and software development seemed to offer all that and so much more.

          Education
          <div class="info">
            My journey into software development started in community college with a painfully slow introduction course into Python. Wanting to challenge myself, I found a Denver local bootcamp called <a href="https://turing.edu/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software & Design</a> and immediately enrolled into their backend program.<br><br>

            Turing is an accredited online school that, over a 7 month long full-time program, focuses on establishing developers with a solid, and practical foundation. This includes everything from self-driven learning, communication, developer empathy, and even challenging our biases - as well as the software development space as a whole.

          Developer
          <div class="info">
            A backend engineer, that's looking for his first real step into software development. Early in my career, I was given the opportunity to contract with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/vangst/" target="_blank">Vangst</a> for 3 months, and help migrate their legacy React backend into Ruby on Rails.
